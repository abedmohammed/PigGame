<!-- How to play -->
## Instructions 👨‍🏫 ##

To use, download the files and open index.html on your browser

<br>

This is a 2-player game

The goal is to reach 20 points

You gain points by rolling the dice, which increases your current points, then holding to store those points

You can keep rolling the dice and increasing your current points 

Your turn only ends when you decide to hold your points, or you roll a 1 which removes all your current points
